Traveling around the world to places, like South Korea and Costa Rica, as a military brat and a college student, I discovered my passion for learning foreign languages. However, it was not until the fall of 2016 when I decided to pursue a longtime interest in computer related fields that I discovered that passion extended to learning computer languages as well. After going through a few online Web Development lessons, I realized I really enjoyed being able to create programs using programming languages, like JavaScript, to do an infinite number of things and the challenge of solving problems to make those programs function. Since then I have continued to utilize online courses, like Free Code Camp and Codecademy (view more of the courses I have completed [here](courses.html) ), to learn Web Development skills and apply those skills by doing projects. I am working to become a Full Stack Developer and am looking for any opportunities in either Frontend or Backend Development or both.
