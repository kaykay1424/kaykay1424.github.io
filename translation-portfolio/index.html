						<p>Ever since I had the opportunity to live in South Korea for 2 years and discover a new
						language, I have loved learning languages as well as traveling and learning about new
						cultures. Over the years I have dabbled in 8 languages, such as French and Korean, and after
						9 years of studying Spanish and 5 years of studying Chinese, I have reached an advanced level
						of proficiency in both languages.</p> <p> My language studies began when I was in high school in
						South Korea but peaked while I attended the University of Tennessee at Knoxille where I
						majored in International Business and Spanish with a Chinese minor. During my college career,
						I had many language learning experiences. I was involved in language and culture groups, such
						as the Latin American Student Organization and the Chinese Culture Club. From my sophomore to
						my junior year, I worked at the International House on campus that provided cultural
						programs, such as the World Showcase, the International Festival, and Language Tables. I
						participated in several of these programs, especially the Spanish and Chinese Language
						Tables. During the summer of my sophomore year, I studied abroad in Costa Rica for a month
						where I improved my fluency in Spanish and gained a good cultural understanding of the Costa
						Rican people by living with a host family and adhering to a Spanish-only policy. During my
						junior year, I helped interpret for UT’s Immigration Clinic during a few legal interviews and
						taught a few courses at Knoxville’s Hispanic Center to Spanish-speaking students. During my
						senior year, I helped interpret for the Center for Sport, Peace, and Society during a tour of
						UT’s academic facilities given to a group of Venezuelan coaches. Also during this year, I
						began working as a volunteer translator for the website Watching America where I would
						translate 1 article giving an opinion on the U.S. or an issue related to the U.S. from
						Spanish to English every 2 weeks.<p> Additionally, during this time, I worked as a tutor of
						Spanish and Chinese where I was not only able to solidify my knowledge of the two languages
						but was also able to help my tutees considerably improve their performance in their courses. 
						After graduating, I spent 2 months in China on the Critical Language Scholarship program
						where I gained a great understanding of Chinese society, culture, and history and
						significantly improved my Chinese skills by adhering to a Chinese-only policy and living with
						a host family, like I did in Costa Rica. </p> <p> Upon returning to the U.S., I continued translating
						for Watching America and obtained a bilingual customer service job at Farmers Insurance that
						allowed me to significantly improve my Spanish speaking skills by interpreting from Spanish
						to English and English to Spanish for customers and Farmers staff.  I now hope to gain more
						experience and pursue a career in the translation field. </p>
